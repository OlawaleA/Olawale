Boom!!!, as the sound progressed it became harder to breathe. It was nearly
impossible to understand the circumstances of this situation. Josh bolted pass me
"Sarah RUN!!". I began to pace and breathing heavily, every step I felt the rush through my vein,
'What have done !?'. There lied the horrid beast, in his eyes there were endless
flames and a hungry beast that wants to eat me lol.
# Funny stuff lmao :D
